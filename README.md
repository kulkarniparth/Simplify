Simplify
Simplify is a web based project management system developed and designed to ease the process of managing Third Year mini 
project activity. It is a system keeping students, teachers and coordinators at its center. In order to overcome all the
anomalies and difficulties in the existing system, we have developed “Simplify”, a project to actually simplify all the 
Project related activities. The system provides the students the faciltiy to fill out all the detail info of their project.
Students and Teachers have the faciltiy to view previous year projects to avoid repetition of topic and discover new topics. 
Teachers and Project Co-ordinators can issue notices and plan all the details of timelines and can guide the students accordingly.
The major advantage of such system is that it eliminates the existing problems of inconsistency, reduncy and errors in handling
the spread sheets. Students, Teachers and Coordinators can collaborate and can concentrate on actual project innovation rather than focusing on management stuff.
